Despite my background in surveying engineering I have had a passion for computer science since high school. The only reason I chose GIS as my graduate level major was its closeness and relevance to computer science. I have worked with different software companies and have developed miscellaneous applications based on many software platforms specially in GIS.

I have a growing passion for open-source software and contributed to some packages, all can be found on my [github profile](https://github.com/faridcher). I usually compile and use open source tools that are written via GNU C++ in Windows using Ming/Msys.

Right now I am extremely involved in my research focused on movement ecology. I am trying to analyze Asiatic cheetah movement patterns and link its behavior to ambient environment.

Here is a short list of my professional history.

## Technologies
A compact list of the technologies that I have had real world projects and I care about.

|Platform|Languages|Applications|
---|---|---|
ESRI|C#, Python, JavaScript/HTML5|ArcObjects, ArcGIS Desktop, Server, ArcSDE, ArcPy, WinForm, WPF|
GE Smallworld|Magick, C++|Smallworld GIS, Oracle Insync|
Oracle|PL/SQL, SQL, JavaScript/HTML5|Oracle Spatial and Graph, Mapviewer|
OSGEO|PG/SQL, SQL, C, C++|Postgresql, PostGIS, Mapnik, Mapserver, OSM|

I use `git` as my primary versioning and revision control system and `github` for code sharing.

## Scientific 
Among many programming languages available for scientific purposes including Python, R, Matlab/Octave, Julia and etc, I have chosen R as my primary scientific language because it is both open-source, popular and has a huge community behind it. If I had any performance issue with R I would switch into Julia at any time. Furthermore I have utilized [Oracle R enterprise](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/r/r-enterprise/overview/index.html) with the case of large scale problems when memory shortage had become an issue. 

For academic writings I use RMarkdown, LateX and MS Word in order of preference. Text based formats (`.rmd`,`.tex`,`.rnw`) are always preferred because they can simply be versioned.

## Language
English(Fluent), Persian (Native)

In this post I will describe the procedure to couple R with ESRI Arcpy system.

## Introduction

R is a statistical software with a lot computational capabilities. Many scientists and researchers choose R as their primary development language, thus leading to plenty of state of art techniques and packages to analyze data.
Despite R computational power it may not be very efficient while working with large datasets due to the R high memory footprint, although numerous solutions exist to overcome this issue. On the other hand GIS data, specially raster data tend to be huge and processing them may require a lot of computations. ArcGIS system comprises a powerful Geo-Processing framework coupled with Arcpy-a python site package-capable of automating tons of GIS workflows. 
In this post I am going to present a way to call Arcpy Geo-Processing scripts from R. It is assumed ArcGIS Desktop is installed prior to running the R script. This is important when automation is key in your workflow.
Note that the reverse procedure-call R function from ArcGIS-is also possible using [`R-Bridge`](https://github.com/R-ArcGIS/r-bridge). R-bridge consists of a R package `arcgisscripting` and a set of C++ bindings named `rarcproxy`; it requires ArcGIS 10.3 and above. For further information please see [ESRI R-bridge page on Github](https://r-arcgis.github.io).

## Scenario
Certain Geo-Processing tasks in R are resource intensive and require a lot of time to complete. This includes but not limited to:

- Polygonize raster : to convert a raster to polygon feature class
- DEM to TIN/contour : to convert a digital elevation model in raster format to a TIN i.e. a polyline feature class
- Buffer : to buffer spatial objects specially linear and areal objects
- Polygon overlay : spatial predicate like query i.e. to join layers spatially

Here I demonstrate a simple workflow to run an Arcpy script from within R. I present a boilerplate python script to write in the Arcpy Geo-Processing function and the R code to call the python script. I opt for `raster2polygon`function in `raster` package of R software and compare its performance to `RasterToPolygon_conversion` Arcpy function. I run the scenario on the R logo jpeg image that resides in the `rgdal` installation directory.

## Python script
This python template has one Geo-Processing function namely `arcpy.RasterToPolygon_conversion`; it can be replaced with any other Geo-Processing function in ArcGIS Geo-Processing framework. This script receive the necessary arguments from command line (note the `sys.argv[1]`) and streamlines the process of calling the script from the command line in R.

```python
import arcpy
import sys

arcpy.env.overwriteOutput = True

ras = sys.argv[1].replace('\\','\\\\')
shp = sys.argv[2].replace('\\','\\\\')
#ras = r"C:\Program Files\R\R-3.2.2\library\rgdal\pictures\Rlogo.jpg"
#shp = r"D:\arcgis_geoproc\arcgis.shp"

arcpy.RasterToPolygon_conversion(ras, shp, "SIMPLIFY","VALUE")
```

# R run
I start the R part by writing a simple function to read the raster, polygonize it and then writing it to the disk using `writeOGR`.

```R
# Using R ---------------------------------
raster2polygon <- function(ras,shp){
  
  r1 = raster::brick(ras)
  poly1<-rasterToPolygons(r1, dissolve = T)
  dirr=dirname(shp)
  shpName = basename(shp)
  writeOGR(obj=poly1, dsn=dirr, layer=shpName, driver="ESRI Shapefile")
}

rlog = system.file("pictures/Rlogo.jpg",package = "rgdal")
shpR = "D:/arcgis_geoproc/r"
system.time(raster2polygon(rlog,shp))
```

and the response time is:

|user|system|elapsed|
--|--|--|
49.19|0.06|49.95|

Now I try to run the python script I drafted in the previous section from within R:

```R
# Using Python and ArcGIS -------------------------
pythonScript = "D:/arcgis_geoproc/raster2polygon_sample.py"
shpArc = "D:/arcgis_geoproc/arcgis.shp"
arguments = sprintf('"%1$s" "%2$s" "%3$s"',
                    normalizePath(pythonScript),
                    normalizePath(rlog),
                    normalizePath(shpArc))
system.time(system2('python', args=arguments))
```

this time the response time is almost 4 times faster than R:

|user|system|elapsed|
--|--|--|
0.01|0.03|13.01|

I tested the procedure on a small raster (r logo) file, yet the difference is more significant on  larger and more typical raster imageries that are dealt with in everyday research.

# Plot
Now I plot the result of the two approaches:

```R
# Plotting the results --------------------------
r1 = brick(rlog)
rshp <- readOGR(dsn = dirname(shpR), 
                 layer = basename(shpR))
arcshp <- readOGR(dsn = dirname(shpArc), 
                 layer = gsub(x=basename(shpArc),pattern = '.shp',replacement = '',fixed = T) )

op <- par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plotRGB(r1,main="R logo")
plot(rshp,main = "R result")
plot(arcshp,main = "ArcGIS result")
par(op)
```

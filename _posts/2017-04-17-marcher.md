The marcher, pronounced marshay, is an r package for multi migration and range shift estimation. We ([Eliezer Gurarie](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~egurarie/) and I) managed to publish the package on CRAN and it can now be downloaded from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/marcher/index.html) or be installed directly from R using:

```r
install.packages("marcher")
```

Interested readers can also read the package vignette through [this link](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/marcher/vignettes/marcher.html).
To view the vignette from R use:

```r
vignette("marcher")
```

The relevant paper to the package is in its final phase and is [available here](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.12674).

Feel free to test the package with your data and provide your feedback in 'issues' section of the project [github page](https://github.com/EliGurarie/marcher).

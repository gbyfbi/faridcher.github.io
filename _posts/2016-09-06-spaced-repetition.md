Everybody is learning something fresh everyday. The moment that we realize something is the pleasant "ahha" instant that we succeed to connect the dots and assimilate the concept. Our careless mind believes that understanding will last forever, although the in next couple of days the idea is already stolen by our brain zombies (zombie is a term coined in Learn How to Learn course). The more time interval between the review of the concept the more susceptible to completely forget it. This incur loss of our time, energy and ultimately efficiency. 

## Spaced Repetition
Intuitively people may think they will ingrain and internalize the concept by just repeatedly reading the text at the same time. However our brain doesn't work like this. In this post I will describe a learning technique called "spaced repetition"; a scientificly proved technique to send information from our short-term memory to the every lasting long-term memory. The notion of spaced repetition tells to incrementally increase the time between reviews of the concept. For example see this image from [Learn How to Learn online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/):

Up to now we know that this spaced repetition is in harmony with our brain system. The real question "how do we integrate it with our learning habits"?
I spend most of my time to study on my thesis, programming and learning more literary English. When I learn a new notion related to my field of study, a new programming function or a English word I used to write it somewhere on my computer. The problem with this approach is: although I promise to myself to review the material, I won't. 

## Anki

[Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) is nice piece of open-source software. It is written in pure python and you can easily learn it. There is also an android/ios version and you can sync your data between devices. Anki simultaneously combines slew of learning techniques including the "spaced repetition", "recall" and "mini-testing". It's worthwhile to mention that Anki builds on its predecessor SuperMemo; both underpin "Leitner Box" idea founded by a German scientist called Sebastian Leitner who popularized a method of spaced repetition with paper flashcards.

As of the date I started to use the tool, my learning style is totally changed. Instead of justing writing new stuff somewhere I try to make a simple question out of the newly learned notion, programming function or vocabulary; then add it (create card) to the Anki. At the end of the day spare 10-20 minutes reviewing the cards I have created. Anki has a scoring system: you answer to your own created questions by just recalling and subsequently scoring your answers basing on the strength of your recall. If you recall the answer instantly, It is likely that the answer resides in your long-term memory; on the contrary if you hardly recall the idea, you will tell Anki to re-show the question in the next 1-4 days. The more comfortable you become with the answer the more spaced repetition of the card happens.
